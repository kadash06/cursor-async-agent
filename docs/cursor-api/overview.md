Background Agents API
The Background Agents API allows you to programmatically create and manage AI-powered coding agents that work autonomously on your repositories. You can use the API to automatically respond to user feedback, fix bugs, update docs, and much more!
Background Agents API is currently in beta, we’d love your feedback on it!
​

Repository integration - Work directly with GitHub repositories
Follow-up prompts - Add additional instructions to running agents
