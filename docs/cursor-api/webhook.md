Background Agents API
Webhooks
Receive real-time notifications about background agent status changes

​
Webhooks
When you create an agent with a webhook URL, Cursor will send HTTP POST requests to notify you about status changes. Currently, only statusChange events are supported, specifically when an agent encounters an ERROR or FINISHED state.
​
Webhook verification
To ensure the webhook requests are authentically from Cursor, verify the signature included with each request:
​
Headers
Each webhook request includes the following headers:
X-Webhook-Signature – Contains the HMAC-SHA256 signature in the format sha256=<hex_digest>
X-Webhook-ID – A unique identifier for this delivery (useful for logging)
X-Webhook-Event – The event type (currently only statusChange)
User-Agent – Always set to Cursor-Agent-Webhook/1.0
​
Signature verification
To verify the webhook signature, compute the expected signature and compare it with the received signature:

Copy

Ask AI
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(secret, rawBody, signature) {
const expectedSignature = 'sha256=' +
crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
.update(rawBody)
.digest('hex');

return signature === expectedSignature;
}

Copy

Ask AI
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(secret, raw_body, signature):
expected_signature = 'sha256=' + hmac.new(
secret.encode(),
raw_body,
hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()

    return signature == expected_signature

Always use the raw request body (before any parsing) when computing the signature.
​
Payload format
The webhook payload is sent as JSON with the following structure:

Copy

Ask AI
{
"event": "statusChange",
"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
"id": "bc_abc123",
"status": "FINISHED",
"source": {
"repository": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
"ref": "main"
},
"target": {
"url": "https://cursor.com/agents?id=bc_abc123",
"branchName": "cursor/add-readme-1234",
"prUrl": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/1234"
},
"summary": "Added README.md with installation instructions"
}
Note that some fields are optional and will only be included when available.

Best practices
Verify signatures – Always verify the webhook signature to ensure the request is from Cursor
Handle retries – Webhooks may be retried if your endpoint returns an error status code
Return quickly – Return a 2xx status code as soon as possible
Use HTTPS – Always use HTTPS URLs for webhook endpoints in production
Store raw payloads – Store the raw webhook payload for debugging and future verification
